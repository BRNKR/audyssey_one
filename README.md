   3. Connect your Audyssey microphone to the mic input of your PC or connect your MiniDSP Umik to a free USB-Port.

### Setting up REW

__Tip__: It's a good idea to save your REW project after each chapter, allowing you to return to an earlier stage of your work without needing to re-measure your system.

#### Connecting calibration microphone

- Microphone tip is looking to the ceiling.
- Microphone is located at the listening position at ear height.

##### MiniDSP Umik-1/2

   __Set Output Channel Mapping...__

   - Mapping is wrong for Windows.
   - We don't use it, because REW cannot generate Atmos sweeps.

   __Levels__
   1. Selecton on drop-down ```Use main speaker test signal to check/set elvels```.
   2. Click on ```Check levels...```.
   3. Click on ```Next```.

### Centering the microphone

We will position the microphone at the center between the front left and right speakers. We will then measure a short REW sweep using the right speaker as the timing reference. The first measurement will be with the left speaker, followed by the right speaker. Since the right speaker is the reference, we will measure the distance difference of both speakers to the microphone and adjust the microphone position accordingly.

1. Click on ```Measure```.

   | Settings   | Value                         |
   | ---------- | ----------------------------- |
   | Range      | 10000-24000 Hz                |
   | Level      | 0.00 dBFS                     |
   | Settings   | 64k                           |
   | Timing     | Use acoustic timing reference |
   | Output     | Front-Left Speaker            |
   | Ref output | Front-Right Speaker           |

2. Click on ```Start``` and the measurement begins.
3. Click on ```Measure```.

   | Settings   | Value                         |
   | ---------- | ----------------------------- |
   | Range      | 10000-24000 Hz                |
   | Level      | 0.00 dBFS                     |
   | Settings   | 64k                           |
   | Timing     | Use acoustic timing reference |
   | Output     | Front-Right Speaker           |
   | Ref output | Front-Right Speaker           |

4. Click on ```Start``` and the measurement begins.
5. Click on ```Overlays->Impulse```
   1. Select ```%``` instead of ```dBFS``` in graph.
   2. Zoom in with the ```+``` control
   3. Click ```CTRL + right mouse button``` to measure the distance of the highest peak of the impulse response of measurement 1 (left speaker) to the corresponding same peak of measurement 2 (right speaker).
   4. You can read the distance in meter. Move your microphone to the left or right accordingly.
6. (You can repeat the steps until you find the sweet spot for your microphone.)

### Playing Atmos sweeps

1. Click on ```Measure->From file->Folder symbol```.
   1. Select ```256kMeasurementSweepReferenceFile_0_to_24000_0_dBFS_48k_acoustic_ref_FL.wav```.
2. Check ```capture noise floor```.
3. Check that your ```Input``` calibration file is the selected for your microphone.
4. Click on ```Start```.
5. Wait for progress bar reaching ```Waiting for timing reference...```.
6. Play with VLC Player the Atmos sweep for the specific speaker you want to measure.
7. ```Right-click``` on the Measurement on the left side of REW and name it like listed on Nexus drop-down menu.

- __Result__: You have one measurement for your speaker and named it.

### Measuring

1. Do ["Playing Atmos sweeps"](#playing-atmos-sweeps) for all your speakers.
2. After you measured all your speakers, move your microphone to a new listening position (e.g. 10 cm to the left/right).
3. Repeat step 1 & step 2 for as many positions you like.

- __Result__: You have one named measurement for each speaker position.

### Averaging Atmos sweeps

1. Add a zero as a suffix to the first measurement name (e.g., FR0) to indicate that it is the one we centered in the ["Centering the microphone"](#centering-the-microphone) section and serves as our reference point. Assign sequential numbers to the other measurements for each speaker (the specific numbering doesnâ€™t matter)
2. Select all measurements for one speaker at once. Be sure, that zero-measurement is on top of all of them.
3. ```Right-click on graph``` -> ```Cross corr align```.
4. ```Right-click on graph``` -> ```Vector average```.
5. Rename the new measurement to your speaker name __without__ suffix (e.g. FR).
6. Delete all measurements of that speaker with suffix.

- __Result__: You have a list of cross correlated and vector averaged measurements for all your speakers (FL, C, FR, SR, SL, SW1 ...).

### Matching measurements with A1 Evo Nexus

1. Go to [A1 Evo Nexus](https://brnkr.github.io/audyssey_one/nexus.html)
2. Click on ```Upload sample calibration``` and select your initial Audyssey calibration file on your PC.
3. Start the calibration process by clicking ```Optimize calibration```. The process takes some minutes.
   - Stay in ```SPL & Phase``` view for performance reasons.
   - __*Yellow warnings in the log window cannot be fixed by Nexus. You have to execute the commands by yourself!*__
4. Upload the calibrated ```.ady``` to your receiver with the MultEQ app.

### Nexus Warnings explained

```markdown
Please set 'Subwoofer Mode' to 'LFE + Main', set 'Bass extraction lpf' to 80 Hz in your receiver.
```

- __Explanation__: If your speaker is set to ```Large``` in the ```Speakers -> Speaker Config``` menu and the ```Subwoofer Mode``` is set to ```LFE + Main,``` the crossover frequency in the ```Speakers -> Crossovers``` menu functions as the bass extraction low-pass filter (LPF). The LPF for LFE can be set to either 120 Hz or 250 Hz: 120 Hz if your subwoofer can reach up to 250 Hz, and 250 Hz if it can only reach around 120 Hz.

1. Open your webbrowser and type in
   - ```http://[IP-Address]/``` __or__
   - ```https://[IP-Address]:10443```
2. Turn on your receiver in web interface (if not already on).
3. Set ```Speakers->Bass```

   | Settings       | Value                |
   | -------------- | -------------------- |
   | Subwoofer Mode | LFE + Main           |
   | LPF for LFE    | 120 Hz __or__ 250 Hz |

4. Set ```Speakers->Crossover```

   | Settings | Value           |
   | -------- | --------------- |
   | Front    | 80 Hz (example) |
